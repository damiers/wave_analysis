# Wave Analysis Toolkit (WAT) for Widefield Brain Imaging

A Python toolkit for analyzing wave propagation patterns in widefield optical imaging data of brain activity.

## Features

What WAT contributes toï¼š 
- Phase analysis tools
- Calculation of wave speed and direction
- Visualization of waveform (e.g. flow, arrow, polar hist, ...)
- Detection of wave origin points
- Visualization of wave propagation patterns
- Multiple wave origin identification
- Customizable thresholding and filtering
- ...

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damiers/wave_analysis.git
cd main
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
All functions are saved into function.py 
All demo notebooks are saved into demo.ipynb


## Getting Started

Getting started straightforward by running our demo! Easily to run!

To get started with WAT:

- Download the demo data from: [[Data Resorce Link]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infinity2118/data-for-wave-analysis)
- Run demo.ipynb to see the toolkit in action
- Modify parameters to analyze your own data

The demo notebook provides step-by-step examples for:

- Loading and preprocessing imaging data
- Calculating the wave phase
- Calculating the wave speed
- Visualizing results
- Identifying wave origins
